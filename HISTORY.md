(PE-12084) Ensure URIs are subclassed from URI::HTTPS

The http-cookie library used by faraday cookie-jar relies on the ancient
text of http-cookie, which has not received an update for over two
years. That cookie library erroneously demanded that all URIs must be
subclassed from URI::HTTPS, not accepting a URI::HTTP object with a
scheme set to https. This change hardcodes all the httpdispatchers to
use URI::HTTPS objects for the url_prefix. This should have zero effect
on other middleware, as URI::HTTPS is just a subclass of URI::HTTP.

ConsoleDispatcher to allow for a new 'token' instance variable that can
be set; if the token is set, console dispatchers will attempt to use it
in the request and set the correct routes, directly to the API.

A previous commit moved the organizational unit creation from the init
to the base method to generate a test environment of users and groups
for RBAC; this broke any implementation not using that method to
generate a test environment.

This doesn't add that back, as putting this action in the init was a
mistake; it does, however, give the user the ability to create the ou's
independently, and set the instance variables accordingly.

Prior to this commit, the only real dispatcher available was the
consoledispatcher. The consoledispatcher had much of the base methods
defined in itself, which needed to be pulled out and put into another
class that all other dispatcher classes should be subclassing. This PR
creates a base httpdispatcher, making it more straightfoward to
subclass the httpdispatcher class and build different dispatching
objects.

you want.

This adds methods to generate local users and roles. Previously, the

module and renamed generate_local_user.

While this is a breaking change, none of the tests actually used that
method, and so it can be safely erased.

e.g.

end

def bar(foo=foo)
  puts foo

failures if the dispatcher does not have view access to the console.

the classifier, without causing errors due to duplicate node groups in an
environment.

Beaker and ec2 don't play nice with getting the public ip. It is only
set during initial provision and can be over-ridden. If you also have to
run the script several times, or are using an existing set of nodes for
testing, beaker has no way to get the ec2 instanes public ip address,
mostly because the box it self does not expose it anywhere.  According
to the docs, you can curl the below to get it

Disable ssl verification when using a Unix::Host

Previous to this commit, when passed a Unix::Host (a beaker object) to
connect to, scooter would reach to and talk to the API via the IP
address. However this will fail since the URL we are talking to (the
ip) is not on the cert name.
This commit disables SSL CA verification for now until a better fix can
be found.

Set classifier path for update_classes endpoint

Previous to this commit, the `update_classes` endpoint in the classifier
API was not calling `set_classifier_path` resulting in the code going to
`https://dashboard/v1/update_classes` instead of the api url.
This commit fixes it by adding the `set_classifier_path` to the method.
This should probably be fixed more broadly so each method does not need
to call that method.
